## H.A. test

This is an example of site interaction code (I did NOT do the deisgn on this piece).  The gallery nav is functional, as well as the favorites link - click it to open the "add to favorites" menu.

I'm using css transitions and animation, along with SVG animation on the heart icon (seen when a favorite is added / removed).
